# Core Safety Rules

## Default Behavior
- **Never mutate originals by default**: Only copy into CLEAN directories.
- All operations work on copies first. Originals remain untouched until explicit promotion.

## Promote Operation
- **Must** move original to `__OLD__/Archive` subdirectory.
- **Must** move CLEAN copy into the original's place.
- **Never** delete files automatically.
- **Always** log all actions to LogEvents table.

## Safety Checks
- Before any file operation, verify source exists and is accessible.
- Track all operations in runs with status and progress.
- Allow rollback by reversing archive/swap operation.
