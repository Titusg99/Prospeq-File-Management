# Google Drive Shared Drives Support

## Required Parameters
Every Drive API v3 call **must** include:
- `supportsAllDrives=true`
- `includeItemsFromAllDrives=true`

## Listing Inside Shared Drives
When listing files/folders inside a Shared Drive:
- Use `corpora=drive`
- Use `driveId=<workspace.driveId>` parameter

## Folder Query Pattern
To list children of a folder:
```
'<folderId>' in parents and trashed=false
```

## File Type Detection
- Folder mimeType: `application/vnd.google-apps.folder`
- Always check mimeType before treating as folder vs file

## Operation Rules
- **Always operate on IDs**, not names.
- Folder names can change; IDs are stable.
- When resolving paths, use ID-based lookups.
