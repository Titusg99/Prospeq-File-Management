# Minimal Changes Principle

## Before Editing
- **Always search/index and cite files** before making changes.
- Understand the full context of what you're modifying.
- Check for existing implementations or similar patterns.

## Change Scope
- **Touch the smallest number of files** per change.
- Prefer targeted fixes over broad refactors.
- Make incremental improvements.

## Refactoring
- **No large refactors without explicit plan**.
- Large refactors should be documented in `/docs/ai/DECISIONS.md`.
- Break refactors into atomic, testable steps.

## Testing Impact
- Each change should be independently testable.
- Avoid cascading changes across unrelated modules.
